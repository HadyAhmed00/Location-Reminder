# Location-Reminder
 Project 4 (last project) for udacity nanodigree in android with kotlin
The lessons in this course include Wandering in Goolge Maps with Kotlin, Virtual Treasure Hunt with Geofences, Testing Basic, Intro to Test Double and Dependency Injection, Testing: Survey of Advanced Topics, and Implementing Login on Android with FirebaseUI.

This project use almost all the things that I learned in these lessons.
# What did I learned?
* Firebase (setup Firebase project, register app with Firebase, add sign-in provider for authentication, download google-services.json to app folder directory)
* Google Map (enable Maps SDK for Android in Google Cloud Platform API & Services, setup API usage restriction to my app only, add SupportMapFragment in layout xml, * * * implement OnMapReadyCallback interface)
* Map Features (show current location, add marker, add POI, implement custom map style - map_style.json)
* GeoFences (add geofencing request)
* Location Permission (request ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission)
* Device Location (auto resolve device location if disabled)
* Unit Test (test ViewModel with fake data source)
* Instrumentation Test (use Espresso and Mockito to test the app UI and Fragments Navigation)
* Expresso - library to interact with UI and check UI state
* Mockito - library to check whether method is called
* Koin (use Koin to inject dependencies into repository)
# What the App look like..
